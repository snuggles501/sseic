NOTE TO EDDWARDD:

The source code is in source_code.py. Do not run that script,
you will not have the dependancies to run it, it's just for you to
look at/fuck with. I froze the game as a stand-alone executable binary file
that includes python 3.5 and all the nessicary modules and files
and it should run on any x86 or 64 bit linux machine. The code is sloppy as shit
because the game is a heavily modified clone of a clone, we just tweaked shit,
added shit, so it all just got piled on. Basicly it was just an exercise for my son
and I to do a small project together, and for me to learn to make a stand alone/contained
executable program.
